# Face Recognition
I wanted to build a quick one day project that implemented some basic face recognition functionality. This would be an awesome feature to add to a future large-scale project, but for now, I'm super-stoked with how it turned out!

- upload a photo with faces from your system
- the app automatically locates where the faces are, and an input pops up underneath the face. You can put your friends name here
- on mousenter, a yellow outline places itself around the faces in the photo

In building this, I used Javascript, CSS, HTML, Styled Components, and face-api.js.
